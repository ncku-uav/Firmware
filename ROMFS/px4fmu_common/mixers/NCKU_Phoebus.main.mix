Aileron/Elevator/Throttle/Rudder mixer for NCKU SOLAR UAV Phoebus
==================================================

This file defines mixers suitable for controlling a fixed wing aircraft with
aileron, rudder, elevator, throttle controls. The configuration
assumes the aileron servo(s) are connected to output 0, the elevator to
output 1 and 2, the throttle to output 3 and the rudder to output 4.

Inputs to the mixer come from channel group 0 (vehicle attitude), channels 0
(roll), 1 (pitch), 2 (thrust), 3 (yaw)

CH1: Aileron mixer
-------------
Two scalers total (output, roll).

This mixer assumes that the aileron servos are set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

As there is only one output, if using two servos adjustments to compensate for
differences between the servos must be made mechanically.  To obtain the correct
motion using a Y  cable, the servos can be positioned reversed from one another.

CH2: Elevator mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, roll).

This mixer assumes that the elevator servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.

CH3: Motor speed mixer
-----------------
Two scalers total (output, thrust).

This mixer generates a full-range output (-1 to 1) from an input in the (0 - 1)
range.  Inputs below zero are treated as zero.

CH4: Rudder mixer
------------
Two scalers total (output, yaw).

This mixer assumes that the rudder servo is set up correctly mechanically;
depending on the actual configuration it may be necessary to reverse the scaling
factors (to reverse the servo movement) and adjust the offset, scaling and
endpoints to suit.
